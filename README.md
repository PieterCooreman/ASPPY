# ASPPY — Classic ASP/VBScript Runtime for Python

**Run your legacy Classic ASP pages on modern infrastructure — no IIS required.**

ASPPY is a Python-based runtime that executes Classic ASP (VBScript) pages on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It implements the full Classic ASP object model (`Request`, `Response`, `Session`, `Application`, `Server`) alongside broad VBScript built-in coverage, so most legacy ASP applications just work.

## Why ASPPY?

Classic ASP applications represent decades of business logic. Rewriting them is expensive and risky. ASPPY lets you **keep your existing `.asp` files** and serve them through a lightweight Python HTTP server — no COM, no Windows dependency, no IIS license. Linux typically runs Python 10–30% faster than Windows, increasing the performance advantage of modern frameworks like ASPPY over Classic ASP/VBScript on IIS.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install fpdf2 bcrypt pillow pyodbc
python -m ASPPY.server 0.0.0.0 8080 www
```

Point your browser at `http://localhost:8080` and your `.asp` pages are live.

## The Perfect Prompt ?

Refer AI vibe-coding agents (like OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex agents, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to the developers.md file, which provides important context and guidelines before starting any development in ASPPY. This reduces development time and cost by 30–40% and significantly improves code quality, even when using free AI coding agents. You can also use the prompt builder (https://pietercooreman.github.io/ASPPY/prompt-builder.html) to generate clear-cut prompts to paste in AI coding agents.

## What's Supported

| Area | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| VBScript built-ins (strings, dates, math, arrays) | Near-complete |
| `Request` / `Response` / `Session` / `Application` / `Server` | Near-complete |
| `Scripting.Dictionary` / `Scripting.FileSystemObject` | Supported |
| `ADODB.Connection` / `Recordset` / `Command` / `Stream` | Partial |
| Database backends | SQLite, Access, Excel (read-only), ODBC, PostgreSQL |
| `VBScript.RegExp` | Supported |
| MSXML HTTP & DOM | Partial (security-sandboxed) |
| `CDO.Message` (SMTP) | Partial |
| POP3 / IMAP | Partial |
| `Global.asa` events | Supported |

ASPPY also ships extended helpers beyond classic ASP — JSON encode/decode, ZIP, PDF generation, image processing, and bcrypt password hashing — all accessible from VBScript via the global `ASPPY` object.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `fpdf2`, `bcrypt`, `pillow`, `pyodbc` (install as needed for the features you use)

## Compatibility Notes

ASPPY targets practical app-level compatibility, not byte-for-byte IIS parity. Locale-specific formatting, edge-case type coercion, and COM-level quirks may differ. SQL is executed as-is by the underlying driver — no dialect translation is performed.

If you're migrating a critical application, run your own regression tests against ASPPY alongside IIS before cutting over.
