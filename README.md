# ASPPY - Classic ASP/VBScript Runtime for Python

**Run your legacy Classic ASP pages on modern Python infrastructure - no IIS required.**

ASPPY is a Python-based runtime that executes Classic ASP (VBScript) pages on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It implements the full Classic ASP object model (`Request`, `Response`, `Session`, `Application`, `Server`) alongside broad VBScript built-in coverage, so most legacy ASP applications just work.

And ASPPY is not just a framework on paper - it powers **real, live websites in production today**, serving real users every day. [See them below.](#built-with-asppy--real-websites-real-users)

---

## Quick Start

Install a recent version of Python (>=3.9) via https://www.python.org/downloads/

Open a CMD window or use Powershell:

```bash
pip install asppy[all] --upgrade
```

Put your `.asp` files in a folder - say `www` - and serve it:

```bash
asppy 0.0.0.0 8080 www
```

Point your browser at `http://localhost:8080` and your `.asp` pages are live.

## Why ASPPY?

Classic ASP applications represent decades of business logic. Rewriting them is expensive and risky. ASPPY lets you **keep your existing `.asp` files** and serve them through a lightweight Python HTTP server - no COM, no Windows dependency, no IIS license. Linux typically runs Python 10–30% faster than Windows, increasing the performance advantage of modern frameworks like ASPPY over Classic ASP/VBScript on IIS.

---

## Radically Simple. By Design.

While other frameworks pile on tooling, ASPPY strips it away. This is what sets it apart:

### No build step. Ever.
No `npm install`. No bundlers. No transpilers. No `.ps1` setup scripts. No dependency hell. You edit an `.asp` file, you hit refresh, it's live. **Deployment is a file copy.**

### The entire runtime is under 900 KB - and human-readable
Not 900 MB. **KB.** 40 plain Python files plus one generated locale table (~195 KB zipped) that you can open, read, and understand. No black box, no vendor magic. If you want to know how something works, you just read the source - all of it fits in your head.

### Compiled, not interpreted line-by-line
ASPPY runs on Python, which **compiles code to bytecode** before execution. Your ASP pages aren't re-scanned as raw text on every hit.

### Compiled ASP pages are cached - zero config, auto-invalidating
Each `.asp` page is parsed and compiled **once**, then served from an in-memory cache. Subsequent requests skip straight to execution - no re-parsing, no wasted cycles. And it's **completely automatic**: nothing to enable, nothing to configure. Edit any `.asp` file - includes too - and ASPPY detects the change and recompiles on the next request. No restart, no cache-busting, ever.

### Performance comparable to IIS
Real-world throughput on par with Classic ASP under IIS - and on Linux, where Python typically runs 10–30% faster than on Windows, ASPPY pulls ahead. Without the Windows Server license.

### No giant executables to drag around
No multi-hundred-MB runtime installers, no self-contained EXE blobs, no Docker images you have to babysit. Python + a folder of source files. That's the whole deployment story.

### Runs happily on a nano VPS
**512 MB RAM, 1 vCPU** is enough to serve production traffic. No JVM warm-up, no node_modules eating your disk, no memory-hungry app server - hosting costs measured in single-digit euros per month.

## Built for the AI Era - The Perfect Match for Vibe Coding

ASPPY is a dream partner for AI coding tools like **Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot** and all the other important players. Why? Because the entire runtime is a **readable codebase of under 900 KB** - small enough that any modern LLM (even free models, and certainly the well-known cloud models like Opus, Fable, Gemini, GPT, Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, and friends) can read and understand it **in minutes or less**. No million-line framework to guess about, no hidden magic the AI has to hallucinate around - the model sees the whole picture and gets it right the first time.

For experienced ASP developers, this is a genuinely exciting moment: the skills you've built over decades suddenly pair with the most powerful development tools ever created. Describe the app you want, point your AI agent at ASPPY, and watch it **develop brand-new web apps or re-create existing ASP/VBScript applications in no time - for nearly free**. Legacy modernization, rapid prototyping, full production apps: what used to take weeks of budget and planning now happens in an afternoon. Classic ASP knowledge has never been this valuable - or this much fun to use.

### Getting an AI agent up to speed

ASPPY is newer than every model's training cut-off, so **no LLM knows anything about it out of the box** - and installing a package cannot change that. Knowledge only reaches a model as text in its context window. So the docs travel *inside* the package, and one command hands them over:

```bash
asppy-guide                 # prints developers.md - conventions, object model, gotchas
asppy-guide --list          # every bundled document
asppy-guide --open prompt-builder    # opens a prompt builder in your browser
```

- **Agentic tools** (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, Copilot): run `asppy-guide` and give the agent its output before asking for any ASP. Everything is on disk after `pip install` - nothing to download.
- **Chat assistants** (Gemini, ChatGPT in a browser): they cannot read your disk. Pipe the brief into your clipboard with `asppy-guide | clip` and paste it, or use a prompt builder to generate a complete ready-to-send prompt.

Skip this step and the model will invent an API that doesn't exist. It's the single highest-leverage thing you can do.

To make vibe coding even easier, the ASPPY repo comes with **two prompt builders** that will be a big help in getting the best out of AI LLM models coding ASP/VBScript for you:

- [MVC Prompt Builder](https://pietercooreman.github.io/ASPPY/prompt-builder.html) - generates the perfect prompt for classic MVC-style ASPPY apps
- [SPA (React + ASPPY) Prompt Builder](https://pietercooreman.github.io/ASPPY/prompt-builder-SPA.html) - generates the perfect prompt for single-page apps with a React front-end and an ASPPY back-end

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Python 3.9 or higher must be installed on your server** (Windows, Linux, or macOS).  
Download Python at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> ASPPY is a Python application - Python is required on any machine that runs it, including your production hosting server.

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install asppy
```

That's it. **The core runtime has zero third-party dependencies** - it runs on nothing but the Python standard library, and SQLite works out of the box.

### Optional extras

Some features reach for a third-party library. Each one is imported lazily and only by the feature that needs it, so you install just what your application actually uses:

| Extra | Command | Enables |
|---|---|---|
| `pdf` | `pip install "asppy[pdf]"` | PDF generation (`fpdf2`) |
| `image` | `pip install "asppy[image]"` | Image resize/crop/filter/watermark (`pillow`) |
| `crypto` | `pip install "asppy[crypto]"` | bcrypt password hashing (`bcrypt`) |
| `odbc` | `pip install "asppy[odbc]"` | ADODB via ODBC: Access, Excel, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL (`pyodbc`) |
| `xml` | `pip install "asppy[xml]"` | MSXML full XPath 1.0, XSLT and CDATA (`lxml`, `certifi`) |
| `all` | `pip install "asppy[all]"` | All of the above |

> Skip an extra and the matching feature raises a clear error naming the package to install - nothing else breaks.

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PieterCooreman/ASPPY.git
cd ASPPY
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

---

## Quick Start

Put your `.asp` files in a folder - say `www` - and serve it:

```bash
asppy 0.0.0.0 8080 www
```

Point your browser at `http://localhost:8080` and your `.asp` pages are live.

On Windows you can also just click `start_www.bat` in a source checkout.

> No `.asp` files yet? The repo ships ready-to-run examples the PyPI package deliberately leaves out: [`www_starter/`](https://github.com/PieterCooreman/ASPPY/tree/main/www_starter) (an MVC scaffold to copy), [`www/`](https://github.com/PieterCooreman/ASPPY/tree/main/www) (a minimal welcome page) and [`www_test/`](https://github.com/PieterCooreman/ASPPY/tree/main/www_test) (the language conformance suite, 34 pages covering the whole VBScript surface).

### The five commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `asppy-new myapp` | Create a new app from the MVC starter template - routing, SQLite, views and layout already wired up. **Start here.** |
| `asppy [host] [port] [docroot]` | Serve a folder of `.asp` pages over HTTP. Defaults: `0.0.0.0 8080 web`. Pass `::` as host for IPv6. |
| `asppy-render PAGE.asp` | Render one page to stdout or a file - no socket, no browser. Great for diffing output and CI. |
| `asppy-check FOLDER` | Recursively render every `.asp` page in a folder and report the ones that fail, with file and line number. |
| `asppy-guide` | Print the developer/agent brief. `asppy-guide --list` shows every bundled document. |

Zero to running app, from a bare `pip install`:

```bash
asppy-new myapp
asppy 127.0.0.1 8080 myapp
```

```bash
# render a single page, with a query string and response headers
asppy-render www/default.asp --query "id=42" --show-headers

# render a protected page without logging in
asppy-render www/admin.asp --docroot www --session authed=True

# health-check a whole app (exit code 1 if anything fails - CI friendly)
asppy-check www
```

Every command also works as a module, which is handy in `.bat` files, systemd units and Docker `CMD` lines:

```bash
python -m ASPPY 0.0.0.0 8080 www     # same as: asppy 0.0.0.0 8080 www
python -m ASPPY.server 0.0.0.0 8080 www
python -m ASPPY.cli www/default.asp
python -m ASPPY.check www
```

From a source checkout, `python asppycli.py ...` and `python asppycheck.py ...` keep working exactly as before.

## Compatibility Notes

ASPPY targets practical app-level compatibility, not byte-for-byte IIS parity. Edge-case type coercion and COM-level quirks may differ. SQL is executed as-is by the underlying driver - no dialect translation is performed.

If you're migrating a critical application, run your own regression tests against ASPPY alongside IIS before cutting over.

### Localization: 60 locales, verified against IIS

ASPPY implements the Classic ASP locale model - `Session.LCID`, `Response.LCID`, `<%@ LCID %>`, `GetLocale`/`SetLocale` - across **60 locales**. Formatting, parsing and collation are all locale-aware: `FormatNumber`/`FormatCurrency`/`FormatPercent`, `FormatDateTime`, `MonthName`/`WeekdayName`, `CDbl`/`CDate`/`IsNumeric`/`IsDate`, `Weekday`, and `StrComp` with `vbTextCompare`.

Two deliberate divergences, both chosen so that behaviour is deterministic across hosts:

- **Default locale is 1033 (en-US)** when nothing is set, rather than the host's system locale.
- **`CStr(date)` stays ISO** (`2024-03-05 14:07:09`) while no locale has been selected, so apps that concatenate dates into SQL keep working. Selecting a locale switches it to full IIS formatting.

See the [specifications page](https://pietercooreman.github.io/ASPPY/specifications.html) for the supported locale list and details.

### Character encoding: UTF-8 by default - an intentional break from IIS

Classic ASP under IIS defaults to the **system ANSI codepage** of the host machine - typically `1252` on a Western Windows server, `932` on a Japanese one. ASPPY instead defaults to **UTF-8 (codepage 65001) everywhere**. This is a deliberate divergence, not an oversight:

- ASPPY runs on Linux and macOS, where "the system ANSI codepage" has no meaningful equivalent. There is no coherent host default to inherit.
- Every modern consumer - browsers, `fetch`, JSON APIs, HTML5 - assumes UTF-8.
- VBScript strings are Unicode internally. UTF-8 is the only encoding that round-trips them losslessly; every legacy codepage silently substitutes characters it cannot represent.

| Surface | ASPPY default | IIS default |
|---|---|---|
| `Session.CodePage` / `Response.CodePage` | `65001` | system ANSI (e.g. `1252`) |
| `Response.Charset` | `utf-8` | unset - header omits `charset` |
| `.asp` source files | UTF-8, BOM-tolerant, falls back to `cp1252` | BOM, else `@CODEPAGE`, else metabase |
| `Request.Form` / `Request.QueryString` | decoded as UTF-8 | decoded per `Session.CodePage` |
| `Server.URLEncode` | percent-encoded UTF-8 | percent-encoded per current codepage |

**What this means when migrating.** Pages served as `windows-1252` under IIS are served as UTF-8 by ASPPY and labelled as such in the `Content-Type` header, so browsers render them correctly with no source change. Legacy `.asp` files saved in `windows-1252` also need no conversion - ASPPY detects and decodes them automatically.

You only need to intervene where a **non-browser** consumer expects legacy bytes: CSV exports opened in Excel, fixed-format files for banking or EDI partners, or older integration endpoints that assume `iso-8859-1`. Set the encoding explicitly on those responses:

```asp
Response.Charset = "windows-1252"
```
